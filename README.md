# iSabiVenues – Event Venue Discovery & Booking Platform  

## Problem  
Finding event venues in Nigeria is frustrating. Most planners still rely on word-of-mouth, endless calls, or social media posts. Pricing is opaque, booking is stressful, and cancellations or double-bookings are common.  

## Solution  
I built **iSabiVenues**, a digital marketplace where event organizers and venue owners can connect seamlessly.  
- Organizers discover venues based on location, price, and capacity.  
- Venue owners list and manage their spaces.  
- Booking and communication happen directly on the platform.  

## Features  
- Venue search & filtering (location, capacity, pricing).  
- Secure booking requests.  
- Messaging between organizers & venue owners.  
- Venue management dashboard.
